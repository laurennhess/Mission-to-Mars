# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview 
### Purpose
The purpose of the Mission to Mars analysis is to scrape the Nasa website to retreive the hemisphere items on the app. We will polish the website by scraping with splinter and Beautiful Soup. To display the data that we scrape, we use a Mongo DB to display the Flask app and the scraped data. 
To extract the information we want to display, specifically the hemisphere images, we implement splinter and Beautiful Soup. The HTML file we create will contain the extracted data which will be used as the input for the application to run and displat the formatted information to our local server. 

## Results
From our webscraping, the images of the Mars hemisphere and facts about mars are displayed on our webpage. <img width="618" alt="styled_app" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94096530/165201263-8d0221ab-1607-40e3-8fee-fca42cde0318.png">
